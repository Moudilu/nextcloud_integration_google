# Google integration in Nextcloud

üá¨ Google integration allows you to automatically migrate your Google calendars, contacts, photos and files into Nextcloud.

Note that this is a one-time import and will not keep Nextcloud in sync with Google.

## üöÄ Installation

In your Nextcloud, simply enable the Google Integration app through the Apps management.
The Google Integration app is available for Nextcloud >= 22.

## üîß Setup

The app needs some setup in the Google API Console in order to work.
To do this, go to Nextcloud Settings > Administration > Connected accounts and follow the instructions in the "Google integration" section.

## **üõ†Ô∏è State of maintenance**

While there are many things that could be done to further improve this app, the app is currently maintained with **limited effort**. This means:

- The main functionality works for the majority of the use cases
- We will ensure that the app will continue to work like this for future releases and we will fix bugs that we classify as 'critical'
- We will not invest further development resources ourselves in advancing the app with new features
- We do review and enthusiastically welcome community PR's

We would be more than excited if you would like to collaborate with us. We will merge pull requests for new features and fixes. We also would love to welcome co-maintainers.

If there is a strong business case for any development of this app, we will consider your wishes for our roadmap. Please [contact your account manager](https://nextcloud.com/enterprise/) to talk about the possibilities.

## Limitations

This app can not migrate google photos files due to limitations in the Google Photos API making it too complex for end users.
